*********** SCRIPTABLE OBJECT BASED GAME ARCHITECTURE *******
The idea is to create a game data system for designers to tweak content partially independently of the programmers and also isolated from the scenes
The source of idea https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk
Currently the system is in a very barebone alpha stage

TODO:
Events.
 - Find out how we can create events with various arguments wihtout writing too much boilerplate code

Variables
 - Since we know unity serializes data of scriptable objets modified in play mode we need to find a way to reset all the data back to the state before the play mode.
 - Components might expose the data but they might now be necessarily the varaibles. 
   IMO Components should not really now about that definition is a particular object they should just expose the data they need and we should find a way to inject
   selection of the value from the editor
 - Variable references seem to be redundant. They are basically a double references. The idea was to tweak the value without breaking dependencies in scenes.
 - Conditionals are very barebones and its architecture might not be that good at this moment.
